        <p>Now that we’ve covered quite a bit of HTML, let’s move on to CSS. CSS stands for Cascading Stylesheet and as the name suggests, CSS is all about styling and making your website look gorgeous.</p>
        <p>The latest version of CSS is CSS3. Unlike previous versions of CSS (namely CSS1 and CSS2.1), CSS3 splits the language into different modules so that each module can be developed separately at a different pace. Each module adds new features or
          extends the capabilities of features previously defined in CSS 2.1. Essentially, CSS3 is simply an extension of CSS2.1.</p>
        <p>This book covers the core properties of CSS2.1 as well as a few new properties that are introduced in CSS3. Once you master the core properties, you will have no problems moving on to more advanced properties that are newly added in CSS3. These
          advanced properties allow for more fanciful styling of your website, such as adding transitions and animations.</p>
        <p> In this chapter, we’ll be covering the basics of CSS, including its syntax and order of precedence. However, before going into the syntax of CSS, let’s first learn how to add CSS rules to our web site.</p>

    <section id="Applying_CSS_Code" class='main-section'>
      <header>Applying CSS Code</header>
      <article>
        <p>There are three ways to apply CSS code to our site.</p>
        <p>The first is by linking to an external file. This is the recommended method. To do linking, you need to write your CSS rules in a separate text file and save it with a .css extension. The syntax for adding the rules to your HTML code is</p>
        <code>
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css"&gt;
       </code>
        <p>You add the &lt;link&gt; tag to the head element, between the &lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt; tags. The first two attributes rel and type tell the browser that this is a CSS stylesheet. You do not need to modify them. The last attribute href is where
          you specify the path to the CSS file that you want to link to. A CSS file is simply a file that contains CSS rules, without any HTML tags. An example is shown below. Don’t worry if the code does not make sense to you, we’ll cover them very soon.
          <p>
            <code>
          body { <br>
           &nbsp;&nbsp; margin: 0; background-color: green; <br>
          }
        </code>
            <p>Save this code as “style.css” in the same folder as the .html file. You can then use the &lt;link&gt; tag above to link this CSS file to your HTML file.</p>
            <p>The second method to add CSS rules to our site is to embed the code directly into our HTML source code, within the head element. This is done with the &lt;style&gt; tag. An example is shown below. The embedded CSS code starts after the &lt;style&gt;
              start tag and ends before the &lt;/style&gt; end tag.</p>
            <code>&lt;head&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;style&gt;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;div { <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: blue;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 100px;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;height: 200px;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/style&gt; <br>&lt;/head&gt;
  </code>
            <p>The last method is to use inline CSS. Inline CSS is specified in the start tag of the element you want to apply it to, using the style attribute. Each rule ends with a semi-colon (;). An example is: </p>
            <code>&lt;div style="text-decoration:underline; color:blue;"&gt;Some text&lt;/div&gt;
  </code>
            <p>Out of the three methods, linking is the preferred method. Linking. separates the HTML content from the styling rules and makes it easier to maintain our codes. It is also extremely useful when we need to apply the same CSS rules to multiple
              web pages.</p>
            <p>Embedded CSS, on the other hand,  is commonly used when the rules only apply to one web page.</p>
            <p>Inline CSS is handy when you need to apply a rule to only one element, or when you want to override other CSS rules that apply to the same element. This is because inline CSS has a higher precedence than CSS code added using the other two
              methods. We’ll discuss order of precedence later in this chapter. However, inline CSS mixes styling with content and should be avoided whenever possible.</p>

        <header>Syntax of a CSS Code</header>
        <p>Now that we know how to apply CSS rules to our HTML files, let’s move on to learn some actual CSS code. The first thing to learn about CSS is its syntax, which is relatively straightforward. The syntax is:</p> <code>selector { property : value; property : value; property : value; }</code>
        <p>For instance, if you want to style the contents inside a &lt;div&gt; tag, you write the rule as</p><code>div { <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: green;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;font-size: 12px;   <br>}</code>
        <p>The first word div is the selector. It tells the browser that the set of rules inside the curly brackets { } applies to all elements with the &lt;div&gt; tag.</p>
        <p>Inside the curly brackets, you write all your declarations. You start by declaring the property that you want to set (background-color in the first declaration), followed by a colon (:). Next, you give the value that you want (green in this case).
          Finally, you end each declaration with a semi-colon (;).</p>
        <p>Indentation and line breaks do not matter in CSS. You can also write your declarations like this:</p> <code>div { background-color: green; font-size: 12px; }</code>
        <p>Pretty straightforward right? Great! Let’s move on...</p>

        <header>Selecting an Element</header>
        <article>
          <p>Selecting an Element In the example above, the rules declared in the curly brackets will apply to ALL elements with a &lt;iv&gt; tag. However, most of the time, we want greater variation. Suppose you want one &lt;div&gt; element to have a font
            size of 12px and another to have a font size of 14px. How would you do it?</p>
        </article>

      <section id="Selecting_Classes_and_IDs" class='main-section'>
        <header>Selecting Classes and IDs</header>
        <article>
          <p>There are basically two ways to do it. The first method is to use the id attribute. In your HTML document, instead of just using the &lt;div&gt; tag, you can add an id attribute to it. For instance, you can write
            <p/> <code>&lt;div id=”para1”&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Some text.<br>&lt;/div&gt; <br>&lt;div id=”para2”&gt; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;More text.<br> &lt;/div&gt;</code>
            <p>In our CSS code, we can then select the respective id by adding a # sign in front of the id name. An example is shown below:</p> <code>div {<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: green; <br> }<br>  #para1<br>  {<br>  &nbsp;&nbsp;font-size: 12px;<br> }&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> #para2 { <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;font-size: 14px; <br>}</code>
            <p>This chapter will be continued very soon with following sections:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>More Selectors</li>
              <li>Case Insensitvity</li>
              <li>Order of Precedence</li>
              <li>Display Inconsistency</li>
              <li>Comments</li>
            </ul>
